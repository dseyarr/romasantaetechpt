         <h2>WHAT        IS       CYBERCRIME?</h2>
            <P> Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network.
            While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are 
            carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them. Others use computers or networks to spread malware,
            illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes do both  , target computers to infect 
            them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networks.

            <h3>THE CYBERCRIMINALS</h3>
               <P>  Cybercriminals may target an individual's private information or corporate data for theft and resale. 
                  As many workers settle into remote work routines due to the pandemic, cybercrimes are expected to grow 
                  in frequency in 2021, making it especially important to protect backup data. </P>

             <p> Nowadays, many students own devices and have social media accounts at a young age. Most of them 
               are still unaware of how these things work —such as emails, passwords, two-factor authentication,
               and many more. Students are prone to cybercrimes due to their urge to explore online which makes
               them easy targets. Seminars will open an opportunity for students to be educated regarding this 
               current issue.
